This workflow will run on every push and pull request to the master branch. It checks out the repository, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, builds the application, runs tests, performs static analysis tests, deploys the application to Azure Web App, and cleans up afterwards.

Please note that you need to provide the Azure Web App publish profile as a secret named "AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE" in your repository settings for the deployment step to work properly.
